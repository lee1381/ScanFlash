Project Description: ScanFlash is an application for iOS devices that helps users to memorize and understand vocabulary in their native tongue. This application scans English words from a picture and translates it into a user’s native language or a language he or she would like to learn. To scan words from images, we used Tesseract by Google (https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/), which is one of the most accurate open source optical character recognition (OCR) engines available.

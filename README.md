ScanFlash
=========

Are you ever nervous to go to a foreign country where you don't know the language? Then this is just the application for you!

iScan is an application for iOS devices that helps users to memorize and understand vocabulary in their native tongue. This application scans English words from a picture and translates it into a userâ€™s native language or a language he or she would like to learn. To scan words from images, we used Tesseract by Google (https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/), which is one of the most accurate open source optical character recognition (OCR) engines available. Google Translate (https://cloud.google.com/translate/) is then used to translate the English word into the user selected language.

There are five default categories in iScan: Gallery, All, Favorite, Recommended, and Settings. Gallery contains all pictures taken by the user. All has user picked flashcards made from the pictures with the option to add flashcards to the Favorite category. Recommended will have ten flashcards regenerated by the application per week having a variety of difficulty. Users can create more categories with inputted names in the menu. The ability to take a new picture is available in all categories.

Implemented in Swift, Objective-C, C++, C, SQLite
